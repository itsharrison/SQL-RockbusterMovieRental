# SQL-RockbusterMovieRental
## Introduction
Rockbuster Stealth LLC is a movie rental company that used to have stores around the world. Facing stiff competition from streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime, the Rockbuster Stealth management team is planning to use its existing movie licenses to launch an online video rental service in order to stay competitive.  
## Objective
● Load all of Rockbuster’s data into a relational database management system.   
● Use SQL to analyze the data and answer any business questions that the company may have.    
● The results of my analysis will be presented to Rockbuster management, so I’ll need to visualize the data in an easy-to-consume manner.   
## Key Questions
● Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?

● Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?   
● Where are customers with a high lifetime value based?
